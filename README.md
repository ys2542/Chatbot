All codes must be run under TenforFlow 1.01

To create an env with Python 3.5 and TF 1.01 in macOS Anaconda, execute the following commands in terminal:
```
$ conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
$ source activate tensorflow
$ pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```
You will find a new env called tensorflow besides your root env in Anaconda. Creating such env in Windows or Linux Ubuntu follows the similar procedure, please check https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.0/install/ for more information.
